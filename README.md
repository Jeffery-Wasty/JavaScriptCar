This project required students to draw a car using the JavaScript Canvas element and give the car animated smoke, also using JavaScript.
We made the car from tracing an image and dividing the image into polygons, which were created seperately. The color of the polygons were
tied to a function, so that the color of the car could be changed with the press of a button (default yellow). Smoke was added to the car,
billowing from the exhaust. The placement of the smoke was random, within a given area, and all smoke bubbles migrated to the top right of
the window with a change in x and y, and expanded with a change in the radius. The change in x,y (and additionally the change in road divider x,y) were tied to a slider, enabling the user to speed up and slow down the car with the slider.
